/* graded by Alex Smith */

gave this error: Parsing.hs:(34,1)-(39,28): Non-exhaustive patterns in function parseSubregions' when calling on every file that I tried.

I was never able to produce a map using any of the possible commands, and always gave the above error.

(after it was pointed out that this error could go away by using a version of
the data files which was the same minus the last line, I regraded it):

Regrade:
There's an openfile: Does not exsit error when called with invalid state or year names
ex: ./purple-america USA -rgb a32f23
